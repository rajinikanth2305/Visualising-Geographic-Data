# Visualising-Geographic-Data
In this project, I'll explore the fundamentals of geographic coordinate systems and how to work with the basemap library to plot geographic data points on maps. I'll be working with flight data from the [openflights website](http://openflights.org/data.html). Here's a breakdown of the files I'll be working with and the most pertinent columns from each dataset:
airlines.csv - data on each airline.

country - where the airline is headquartered.<br>
active - if the airline is still active.<br>
airports.csv - data on each airport.<br>

name - name of the airport.<br>
city - city the airport is located.<br>
country - country the airport is located.<br>
code - unique airport code.<br>
latitude - latitude value.<br>
longitude - longitude value.<br>
routes.csv - data on each flight route.<br>

airline - airline for the route.<br>
source - starting city for the route.<br>
dest - destination city for the route<br>
